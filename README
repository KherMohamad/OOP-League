The Program represents a simulation of the CPUs (Computer Players) of a 2D Multiplayer MMORPG style game. The game consists of the following elements:
	-map: is 2D a grid-type map where every unit in the map has a terrain type that can affect the players' gameplay and abilities
	-Champions: characters controlled by the CPUs. Each champion has a class that determines its abilities, an HP bar, an HP limit, Experience points and a level
	-Angels: are non-controllable characters that, depending on their type, can give certain buffs/debuffs to the champions that encounter them
	-Great Magician: essentially represents a log that keeps track of all champions and the relevant interactions bewtween them
The gameplay is round-based with a set number of rounds, and consists of champions roaming around th map and fighting other champions. champions fight each other when they end up on the same unit on the map.
The game ends for a player once their champion reaches 0 HP. A player wins if his champion is alive at the end of the game (once all rounds are over).

The different champions are structured as subclasses of a base Abstract Class Champion. They are spawned using a Champion creator Class that gets the base properties of the character
as an input. The champion creator class is implemented using the Factory Design Pattern.

In addition to their abilities, each champion also has a gameplay strategy, implemented using the Strategy Design Pattern.

Champion battles and champion-angel interactions are implemented using the Visitor Pattern

The Observer Pattern is also used for the Great Magician implementation
